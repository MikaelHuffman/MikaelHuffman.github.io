    <h1>Uncrustables are the best.</h1>
    
    <h2>What are Uncrustables?</h2>
    <p>Uncrustables are similar to Band-Aids in the sense that they are a brand but typically refer to a specific kind of sandwich. Uncrustables are circular, crustless Peanut Butter sandwiches. They are often paired with jelly, but some options come with honey too. They're a moderate size and work very well as a light breakfast or even a snack to get you through the day.</p>

    <p>As you can see, Uncrustables are a very simple, easy-to-eat item. I highly recommend that everyone tries them out. I have four classes back to back on Tuesday/Thursday and I bring two of them with me. Inbetween my second and third class, I eat them. It helps me keep up my energy for my final two classes.</p>
